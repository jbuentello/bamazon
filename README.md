The Bamazon homework assignment was made to somewhat mimic an amazon website. Products are displayed with price, quantity, item ID, and quantity.

Initial phase:
Make a github repository, and get it cloned to my computer. Get connected with MySQl and install all needed dependencies.

Set up Database query and make sure that all data can be pulled into a table. Once all data is pulled create the questions laid out in the homework. After the questions are answered query the database to subtract the amount of items that are purchased. 

If the item is not available set up an alert so that the user know the item is no longert available in that amount.

Below are examples showing all of these processes:
